Welcome to the Research Project!

This is a research based project by which we will learn how to use Doctrine ORM & Slim Framework with CodeIgniter Environment. Slim will provide a web service layer to the CodeIgniter front-end. CodeIgniter will make REST based requests to the Slim service, and slim will use Doctrine for DBAL and will serve data in JSON.  
  
**Goal**  
You will have to make a Login Page using a **User Name** and a **Password**. If authenticated then a page will display with option to add more Users. There will be **Logout** option.
