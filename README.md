Welcome to the Research Project! 

This is a research based project by which we will learn how to use Doctrine ORM & Slim Framework with CodeIgniter Environment. Slim will provide a web service layer to the CodeIgniter front-end. CodeIgniter will make REST based requests to the Slim service, and slim will use Doctrine for DBAL and will serve data in JSON.
